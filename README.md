# Meteor Travel

Based on the project showcased at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6653827
The original author has done a great job at building out the idea, UI, flow etc. This is merely a clone implementation of the same general product.
My claim was that this could be completed in about 1 hour in Meteor.

* Clone of this sweet RoR and Angular project: http://mywanderlust.co/ 
* All done in Meteor
* Built in 56 minutes, close to my 1 hour claim

## Install

To run, 
```
$ ./meteor run
```

To deploy:
```
$ ./meteor deploy
```

You're free to do what you want with the code. No credit necessary.
